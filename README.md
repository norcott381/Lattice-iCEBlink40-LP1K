# Lattice-iCEBlink40-LP1K
Verilog examples for the Lattice LP1K, QN84 package.
This board is very low power (LP) and iexpesinve (< 40$) yet all examples found target the HX1K.  

They are compilable using the IceStorm toolkit, see https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm and http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/. 

1) btn is a Verilog example using to the capacitive buttons signal change to affect LED states on the LP1K board
2) cnt is a Verilog code implementing a binary counter using the 4 onboard LEDs
3) rot is a Verilog code litghting up 1 LED at a time indefinitely
